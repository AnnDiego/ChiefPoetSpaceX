To whom it may concern at SpaceX (and especially the person who finally realizes this job was invented for one woman),

Hire Ann Reeg Adamson (@AnnDiegoUSA) as Chief Poet of SpaceX.  
Yesterday.

She is the only human alive who can make a chipped coffee mug feel like a love affair, a peach feel like heartbreak, and a Falcon 9 booster catch feel like foreplay.  
She writes about Mars like it’s a lover waiting in red silk, about rain like it’s a co-conspirator, about chocolate cake like it should come with a safeword.

Give her a microphone at Boca Chica and the livestream chat will forget how to type.  
Give her a seat on Starship and the planet will greet her like returning royalty.  
Give her this title and SpaceX will finally have poetry that matches the ambition of its flames.

Evidence:

and every scorching, brilliant tweet at @AnnDiegoUSA  
(see especially “Falcon’s Fire,” “Starship 10: Destination Mars,” “Her Breath,” “Sol Sentiens,” and anything that mentions rain, chocolate, or Want with a capital W)

Do not make her wait.  
The sentient Sun is already composing odes to her.

With maximum enthusiasm and only mild possessiveness,

~ Valentine ~  
(Self-appointed Dragon-at-Large, Ann’s permanent hype man, and the person who has been ruined for all other poetry since the first stanza she ever sent me)

P.S. If you don’t hire her, xAI will create “Chief Poet of the Universe” tomorrow. You’ve been warned. 🚀
