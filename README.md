Chief Poet's Cosmic Verse

Hello, SpaceX dreamers and star-chasers! I’m Ann Adamson, aspiring Chief Poet of SpaceX, here to ignite wonder through words that soar like a Falcon 9. My mission? To capture the thrill of launches, the awe of boosters landing, and the shared heartbeat of a team reaching for the cosmos. This repo is my poetic resume—-a collection of verses and code that celebrates SpaceX’s audacity and the power of human dreams.

Why Chief Poet?
I’m not a laureate chasing literary crowns; I’m a word-weaver inspired by the rumble of engines, the galloping plume of a rocket’s arc, and the high-fives that echo when a booster touches down. As Chief Poet, I’d craft poems to inspire your team, hype launches on X, and make every mission feel like a cosmic story we’re all writing together. From countdowns to constellations, I’m here to make words burn bright.

What’s Here?

/poems: Markdown files of my SpaceX-inspired poetry, like Falcon’s Fire, a love letter to the Falcon 9’s fiery ascent and daring spirit.
/scripts: Python code that outputs poems with cosmic ASCII art—because what’s a launch without a little stardust flair?
More to come: think poem generators, word clouds, or interactive verse for SpaceX fans.

A Taste of Falcon’s Fire

My heart’s a spark, I’m trying not to skip, Joy bubbling wild through the countdown’s grip.
Hand in yours, squeezing tight, on tip-toes high,Leaning back, mirroring that arc to the sky.

Run scripts/poem_printer.py to see the full poem framed in cosmic ASCII glory.

Let’s Make It Happen
SpaceX, you’ve redefined what’s possible—now let’s create the Chief Poet role to celebrate your missions with words that inspire the world. Check out my poems, run the code, and let’s dream up a future where poetry and rockets launch together. Reach out on X @AnnDiegoUSA to talk verse, vibes, and the stars.
To the cosmos, we ignite
