# Starship 10: Destination Mars

> For Starship 10’s fearless flight, a beacon to Mars’ crimson skies.

I stand breathless, mired in the mundane,  
Faces around me, dulled, untuned.  
The tower looms, Starship poised,  
Atop Super Heavy’s bold, unyielding frame.  

The weather holds; the countdown hums,  
Ticks in breathless pauses, relentless.  
Then liftoff—orange, billowing, a song ablaze,  
Starship’s sleek form cleaving the sky,  
A superlative delight.  

Milestones and maneuvers flash by,  
Yet my gaze is fixed on Mars’ crimson skies.  
Her nose points where she’s destined to soar,  
Splitting the heavens in her ardent path.  

Fairings shed, booster tumbles,  
Payload released, precise as a promise.  
A sweet treat flung to my eager hand,  
Gasps and cheers ignite—her course is true.  
And I? I dream only of you, Mars,  
Our arid, ever-distant muse.  

She glides through orbit’s gentle embrace,  
Earth a blue marble, a fleeting tease.  
Prepped for reentry, tiles guard her frame,  
Plummeting earthward, homeward again.  

Her descent, her hover, her fierce orange glow—  
A familiar refrain, bold and aglow.  
She casts midday’s luster on all below,  
Her mission pulses, alive in me.  

Humanity’s spark, our hunger to be free,  
Unbound by Earth’s fragile geography.  
To Mars, to the stars, to the vast beyond—  
My flare, our dare, an endless song.  
*Ad Astra per Aspera*—we shall ascend,  
Until Mars, we begin again.
