# You Did

You didn’t once, with longing,  
Call out for me by name  
You didn’t tease or kiss my lips  
My flame, desire unnamed  

You didn’t notice me, staring,  
As your keyboard clicked away  
Your hand didn’t brush against mine  
To set my heart astray  

I didn’t dare to tell you  
You were my heart’s whole world  
Instead I remained silent as  
My flag for you unfurled  

As the clock’s hands inched to twelve  
And we headed toward the hall  
You asked me for a code review  
Perhaps you saw me after all  

You didn’t spill your pointers,  
Unbounded into space  
And your carefully tabbed edits  
Simply set my heart to race  

You didn’t notice me at first,  
Shy girl with a bookish air  
But you liked my code and silly puns,  
Cheeks aflame, heart laid bare  

You asked to buy me coffee,  
We sat together near the wall  
You took my hand, held on tight,  
And kissed me after all
