# Falcon's Fire
# Inspired by SpaceX Falcon 9 Launches

Beneath the velvet night, stars pierce the dark,  
A rocket’s trail blazes, a stallion’s clear arc.  
White plume gallops, free against the black,  
We crane our necks, hearts racing, no turning back.

Steady countdown, a pulse through static air—  
Max Q, stage split, fairings shed with care.  
Online, we hang on every technical beat,  
While above, the sky reflects a true cosmic feat.

Neighbors drift near, eyes tilted to the stars,  
Strangers bound by wonder, no fences, no bars.  
Soft words weave through the night, still and spare,  
Shared dreams of flight lift hearts where they dare.

I yearn for the launchpad’s raw, trembling roar,  
Flames erupting, smoke billowing, engines that soar.  
To feel the ground quake, the acrid burn bite,  
Vibrations that sing of the rocket’s wild flight.

My heart’s a spark, I’m trying not to skip,  
Joy bubbling wild through the countdown’s grip.  
Each second ticks, a thrill I can’t contain,  
The sky’s alive, calling us to its flame.

Hand in yours, squeezing tight, on tip-toes high,  
Leaning back, mirroring that arc to the sky.  
You’d wrap me close, ground me to earth’s embrace,  
As we chase the fire that dares to leave this place.

The pomp, the cheers, the countdown’s steady fall,  
Technical chatter weaving magic through it all.  
We’d jostle for views, your touch soft on my cheek,  
My eyes alight, too entranced to even speak.

And oh, to see the booster glide back down,  
Caught gently by the tower, no crash, no sound.  
Applause would erupt, high-fives spark the air,  
A team’s dream landing, proof we dared to dare.

What must it feel, to build this skyward art?  
A thousand hands, one goal, beating as one heart.  
Exhilaration, relief, or sleep that won’t come—  
The weight of the stars, the pride of “It’s done.”

From earth to the cosmos, we reach, we ignite,  
In the rocket’s bright trail, our dreams come alive.
