# Falcon's Fire

A poem celebrating the fiery might of SpaceX’s Falcon 9, crafted as part of my quest to become Chief Poet for SpaceX.

## Falcon's Fire  
_Inspired by SpaceX Falcon 9 Launches_  

Beneath the velvet night, stars pierce the dark,  
A rocket’s trail blazes, a stallion’s clear arc.  
White plume gallops, free against the black,  
We crane our necks, hearts racing, no turning back.  

Steady countdown, a pulse through static air—  
Max Q, stage split, fairings shed with care.  
Online, we hang on every technical beat,  
Above, sky reflects a true cosmic feat.  

Neighbors drift near, eyes tilted to the stars,  
Strangers bound by wonder, no fences, no bars.  
Soft words weave through the night, hush and rare,  
Shared dreams of flight lift hearts where they dare.  

I yearn for the launchpad’s raw, trembling roar,  
Flames erupting, smoke billowing, engines that soar.  
To feel the ground quake, the acrid burn bite,  
Vibrations that sing of the rocket’s wild flight.  

Heart sparking, childlike, I’m trying not to skip,  
Joy bubbling wild through the countdown’s grip.  
Each second ticks, a fire I can’t contain,  
The night sky alight, calling me to its flame.  

Palm in yours, squeezing tight, on tip-toes high,  
Leaning back, mirroring the arc to the sky.  
You’d wrap me close, ground me to earth’s core,  
As we chase the fire that dares to leap and soar.  

The pomp, the cheers, the crowd’s electric call,  
Technical chatter fuels the magic through it all.  
We’d jostle for views, your hand warm on my cheek,  
My eyes alight, too enchanted to speak.  

And oh, to see the booster glide back down,  
Caught gently by the tower, no crash, no sound.  
Applause would erupt, high-fives light the air,  
A team’s dream landing, proof we dared to dare.  

What must it be to craft this skyward art?  
A thousand hands, one goal, a single heart.  
Sleepless nights, exhilaration, relief held in sum  
The weight of the stars, the pride of “It’s done.”  

From earth to the cosmos, we reach, minds ignite,  
In the rocket’s fierce trail, our dreams finally take flight.
