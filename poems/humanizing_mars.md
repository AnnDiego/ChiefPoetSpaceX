# Humanizing Mars

A haiku series celebrating SpaceXâ€™s mission to make Mars a home for humanity, crafted as part of my quest to become Chief Poet for SpaceX.

## Haiku Series

Jet black deep of space  
Burning dot on horizon  
Glowing barely red  

---

Land of lore and dreams  
A distant dystopia  
Terrifying, grand  

---

Dusty and sterile  
The brick red plastered surface  
Inorganic, harsh  

---

Cold rugged terrain  
Playground for rovers and men  
Red clay desert world  

---

Cydoniaâ€™s face  
Alit in fine, stark beauty  
Warmed by our same sun  

---

Red skin, to the eye, hot  
Yet unforgivingly cold  
Stoic in umber beauty  

---

Starshipâ€™s fire ascends  
Red queenâ€™s cold gaze holds steady  
Dreams stir her silence  

---

Quest to unite worlds  
Rocketâ€™s flame dares broach red skies  
Her patient frown holds  

## About
These haikus capture the awe and challenge of colonizing Mars, inspired by Starshipâ€™s journey. Check out my Starship Flight Test 10 poem puzzle in `scripts/starship10/` for a techy, cheeky ode to the mission, and see my full Chief Poet vision in the repoâ€™s main `README.md`!
