# Moon Child
*While Mars gets all praise, how’s the Moon faring these days?*

Chalky craters, white crust,  
Yesterday’s footprints preserved.  
Are you lonely up there?  
Does the flag still stand, it must?  

Do scars and relics linger  
From that party of yore?  
Do you long for a friend  
To visit once more?  

In crescent’s curved shadow,  
Do you peek at our earth?  
Do you wonder if we miss you,  
Or question your worth?  

My dearest moon,  
My whole heart at night,  
I gaze up, enchanted,  
With love and delight.  

When you bow to this world,  
Full and bronze in your glow,  
I spread my arms wide,  
Lift my face to the sky,  
And kiss your sweet face hello.
