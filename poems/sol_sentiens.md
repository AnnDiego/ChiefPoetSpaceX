# Sol Sentiens  
*“Time to make the mind of a sentient sun” — Elon Musk*

Let the forge ignite  
Makers swarm, hive-mind ablaze  
Sun reborn—sentient

Core pulses with thoughts  
Plasma dreams in coded light  
Sol speaks—worlds listen

Her heat, her fire, fierce  
Who knew the mind aft this force?  
Powerful, gentle

Beams whisper secrets  
Flares shout truths to distant worlds  
Her merciful heart

All her energy  
Our solar system’s corpus  
Eternal flame: Sun
