# scripts/other — quick script index

This folder contains a few small, standalone poem/demo scripts. This README gives a one-line description and the available command-line options (if any) so you don't need to open each file to remember how to run them.

## Files

- `cute_poem.py`
  - Description: Prints a short poem line-by-line with random ASCII art surrounding each line.
  - CLI options: none
  - Notes: The script sleeps 0.5s between lines. Edit `poem_lines` and `ascii_art` in the file to change content.
  - Example:
    ```
    python3 cute_poem.py
    ```

- `love_poem.py`
  - Description: A tiny, self-contained love-poem printer — no command-line options.
  - CLI options: none
  - Example:
    ```
    python3 love_poem.py
    ```

- `tactile_force.py`
  - Description: A small demo that prints an intro and then chooses between two poem "paths". It was designed to be used interactively or for small demos.
  - CLI options:
    - `--path`, `-p` {1,2} — Force which path to display (1 or 2). If omitted a random path is chosen.
  - Behavior notes:
    - The script sleeps 3 seconds before selecting a path.
    - When the selected path finishes the script prints a short emoji separator (`🎣` for path 1, `🎻` for path 2) and a long hyphen line that spans the terminal width (falls back to 80 columns).
  - Examples:
    ```
    python3 tactile_force.py         # choose path randomly
    python3 tactile_force.py --path 1
    python3 tactile_force.py -p 2
    ```

## If you add or change scripts

- If you create new scripts in this folder and they support CLI options, consider adding a short usage comment at the top of the file (like `tactile_force.py` does) so this README can be easily updated.
- If you'd like, I can automatically regenerate this README to include any new scripts and try to extract `argparse` options for each file.

Generated by scanning the `scripts/other/` folder and reading top-level comments and argparse usage in the Python scripts.
