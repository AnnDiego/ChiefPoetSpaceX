your rigid gleaming steel frame
fairings in dual form your pointy tip
engines ignite with thrust enough
to make hearts skip a beat to roar

Super Heavy lofts me high
my mighty length reaching the sky
supported by my ample girth angels cry
my Mars goal flaunting its true worth

fins that flare to form shaped
hex tiles patterns gleam repeat
enter shimmering black if you dare
catch me in your arms you tease swift and neat

Super Heavy unmatched flares
booster thrusts heat sends plumes
Raptor engine fires fierce it glows
nimble rising hard and swift
